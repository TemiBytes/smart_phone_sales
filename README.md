## SMART PHONE SALES

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This Power BI project presents a comprehensive analysis of smartphone sales across different regions and brands. The goal was to explore trends, evaluate performance across markets, and help stakeholders make data-driven business decisions using interactive visualizations.

## DATASET OVERVIEW

**The dataset contains ales information on smartphones, including:**

- Product Category: Smartphone model, color, operating system, storage size and brand

- Sales Region: Geographic breakdown by City

- Sales Channel: Partner, Online, Retail Store

- Units Sold, Unit Price, Total Revenue

- Customer Demographics - Age group 

## BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

- Track and compare monthly sales trends

- Analyze top-performing products by revenue and quantity

- Monitor regional performance to identify high/low-performing zones

- Provide executives with a dashboard overview for fast decision-making

## DASHBOARD FEATURES

**The Power BI dashboard includes:**

# OVERVIEW PAGE:

- Total Revenue

- Total Unit Sold

- Count of Unique Transactions

- Monthly Revenue Trends

Sales by Region

# BRAND PERFORMANCE :

- Units sold by brand

- Gartner Magic Quadrant for Brands  and Phone Models

- Top Model by Brand

- Revenue Generated by Brand

# REGIONAL ANALYSIS:

- Revenue by City (Heat Map)

- Revenue generated by customer age group, and gender (Drill down)

- Average Price by Brand


## DAX MEASURES & FORMULAS

**KPIs**
- Average Price = AVERAGE(Fact_Sales[Price])
- Avg of Units Sold = [Units Sold]/5
- Revenue Generated = SUM(Fact_Sales[Total Revenue])
- Total Transactions = DISTINCTCOUNT(Fact_Sales[Transaction_ID])
- Unique Product Sold = DISTINCTCOUNT(Fact_Sales[ProductID])
- Units Sold = SUM(Fact_Sales[Units Sold])

**MOM**
- `MoM Average Price = 
VAR CurrentDate = MAX('Dim Calendar'[Date])
VAR PrevMonthName = 
    CALCULATE(
        SELECTEDVALUE('Dim Calendar'[Short Month]), 
        PREVIOUSMONTH('Dim Calendar'[Date])
    )
VAR PrevMonthValue = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Average Price], 
        PREVIOUSMONTH('Dim Calendar'[Date])
    )
VAR CurrentValue = [Average Price]
VAR MoMChange = 
    IF(
        NOT(ISBLANK(CurrentValue)) && NOT(ISBLANK(PrevMonthValue)),
        DIVIDE(CurrentValue - PrevMonthValue, PrevMonthValue),
        BLANK()
    )
RETURN
        IF(
            NOT(ISBLANK(MoMChange)),
            IF(
                MoMChange > 0,
                "↑ " & "+" &""& FORMAT(MoMChange, "0.0%") & " Vs " & PrevMonthName,
                "↓ " & "-" &""&FORMAT(ABS(MoMChange), "0.0%") & " Vs " & PrevMonthName
            ),
            "No Selection or Data"
        )`

- Same logic is applied to MOM Revenue, MOM Transaction, MOM unique product sold, MOM units sold
- Color = 
SWITCH(SELECTEDVALUE('Model Color'[Model Color Order]),
    0, "Black",
    1, "#094780",
    2, "#48bd7b",
    3, "White",
    4, "Red",
    "grey"
)

**ADDING NEW PARAMETERS**
- Model Color = {
    ("B", NAMEOF('Dim_Model_Image'[Black Url]), 0),
    ("B", NAMEOF('Dim_Model_Image'[Blue Url]), 1),
    ("G", NAMEOF('Dim_Model_Image'[Green Url]), 2),
    ("W", NAMEOF('Dim_Model_Image'[White Url]), 3),
    ("R", NAMEOF('Dim_Model_Image'[Red Url]), 4)
}

KPIs = {
    ("Total Transactions", NAMEOF('Calculations'[Total Transactions]), 0),
    ("Revenue Generated", NAMEOF('Calculations'[Revenue Generated]), 1),
    ("Units Sold", NAMEOF('Calculations'[Units Sold]), 2)
}

## SUMMARY INSIGHTS
- Apple phones fall under the category of premium leaders in the smartphone market
- Xaomi identified as a weak performer due to low sales despite its affordable price.
- Credit card was the preferred payment plan
- Online Stores made the most sales. This can be largely due to the ease of customers ordering from the comfort of their homes.

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
- Power Query for ETL
- Microsoft Excel (For data Cleaning and pre-processing)

## CHALLENGES & LEARNING

**Challenge:**

- Visualizing multiple KPIs without cluttering the executive summary.

**Approach to Solution:**

- Used card visuals and a responsive layout grid to maintain clarity while presenting many metrics.

**Key Learning:**

Leveraging DAX time intelligence functions improved our ability to analyze trends and compare across periods.
